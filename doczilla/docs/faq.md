# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Groot?

Groot is a universal translation guardian designed to work with multiple frameworks and languages. It provides dynamic translation loading, type-safe translations, and a suite of CLI commands for managing translation files.

## How does Groot detect my translations?

Groot automatically scans your projectâ€™s source code for translation keys and compares them with the keys defined in your translation files. It even checks for dynamic translation key usages.

## How do I add a new locale?

Use the CLI command:

```bash
npx groot add-locale
```

This command will prompt you for details about the new locale and update your configuration automatically.

## How do I add a new translation key?

Run:

```bash
npx groot add-translation
```

You'll be prompted for the key name and an optional default value, and the key will be added to all translation files.

## Can I use Groot with my existing translation setup?

Yes! If you already have translation files, Groot will detect them automatically during initialization and use them to generate a consistent configuration.

## Does Groot support RTL languages?

Absolutely. Each locale configuration includes a `direction` property (either `ltr` or `rtl`), and Groot automatically handles text direction in your application.
